* pytest-pdb-break
See atop the main file for additional options and info, also =pytest-pdb-break-extra.el= for
convenience functions, integration tips (Elpy), and more.

** Installation
MELPA: =M-x package-install RET pytest-pdb-break RET=

** Usage
With point in the body of some test, run =M-x pytest-pdb-break-here=.

That's the only real command. By default, =C-u= will trigger a prompt for pytest options,
which are included in subsequent runs until cleared. Clearing is done by killing the input
line or calling the command with =C-u 0=. Prompt history and file-path completion should
work as expected, but pytest option names have yet to be added.

Persistent options can be stored in ~pytest-pdb-break-extra-opts~. These are inserted before
per-session options in the command line.

The main command activates a minimal minor mode whose hook is handy for rigging up
PDB-related tasks like ~realgud~ tracking, etc. It runs inside the ~inferior-python-mode~
buffer just after it's created and again when it's killed.
