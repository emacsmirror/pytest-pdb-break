*pytest_pdb_break.txt*            For Nvim and Vim 8         Updated: 2018 Dec

This is just an example plugin. It currently depends on the built-in python
filetype plugin and will fail if it isn't loaded. The python interpreter will
be the same one shebanged in the reigning pytest executable (in PATH).


Commands~

:PytestBreakHere {args}

    The only command. Cursor must be in a test function. Any {args} are passed
    on to pytest. For example, `:PytestBreakHere -o addopts=` will disregard
    an addopts directive in your pytest ini.


Overrides~

g:pytest_pdb_break_overrides

    Most autoloaded funcs can be overridden. For example, a general-purpose
    runner (no PDB):
>
    function! g:pytest_pdb_break_overrides.runner(...)
        return self.split(self.get_context().exe, self.get_node_id())
    endfunction
